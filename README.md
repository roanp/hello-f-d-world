# hello-f-d-world
now I did  a  branch  and I will merge  to master  soon . 
this  is  my  first  update from command  line  terminal. :
my first repo, I will do it
This is  my  first  change  to a  git stored  file. I am a computer  network administrator who has  been feeling bored  in front of  the computer   surounded  of  cables, routers, servers.  I am turning  up a new leaf and I will unleash  this  misterous  world  of  software  engeniiering and computer programming.
